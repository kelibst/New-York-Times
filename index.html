            <p class="stories-text">CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan
              Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations,
              venturing far beyond the world of known physics.</p>
            <p class="stories-text">He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that
              should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to
              begin with. A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have infused space itself
              with a special energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed
              of
              light for a prodigiously violent instant.</p>

            <p class="stories-text">If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look
              uniform
              - from pole to pole and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the
              wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like
              spit in the ocean.</p>

            <p class="stories-text">“SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a
              double
              box around it.</p>


            <p class="stories-text">
              On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen the beginning of the
              Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.

              Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver of cosmic time with telescopes at the South
              Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics
              detected
              ripples in the fabric of space-time — so-called gravitational waves — the signature of a universe being
              wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second old.
              They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that
              Dr. Guth was correct.

              Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, including Dr. Guth, wondered
              whether it could ever be proved.

              If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable to the recent discovery
              of
              dark energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast realms of time and
              space and energy to science and speculation.

              Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion light-years in space with
              its
              hundreds of billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose extent,
              architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an endless number
              of
              other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling over.
            </p>


            <p class="stories-text">
              ‘As Big as It Gets’

              In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces operating at energies forever beyond the
              reach of particle accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself. Dr. Kovac’s ripples
              would be the first direct observation of gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of
              general relativity, should ruffle space-time.

              Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe expert who was not part of the team,
              said,
              “This is huge, as big as it gets.”

              He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe, sending a telegram encoded in
              gravitational
              waves.”

              The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of microwave radiation that permeates
              space and preserves a picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot as the surface of
              the
              sun.

              Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as Bicep, for Background Imaging of Cosmic
              Extragalactic Polarization, reported their results in a scientific briefing at the Center for Astrophysics
              here on Monday and in a set of papers submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.

            <p>Dr. Kovac said the chance that the results were a fluke was only one in 10
              million.</p>
            <p>Dr. Guth, now 67, pronounced himself “bowled over,” saying he had not

            “With nature, you have to be lucky,” he said. “Apparently we have been lucky.”

            The results are the closely guarded distillation of three years’ worth of observations and analysis.
            Eschewing email for fear of a leak, Dr. Kovac personally delivered drafts of his work to a select few,
            meeting with Dr. Guth, who is now a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (as is his son,
            Larry, who was sleeping that night in 1979), in his office last week.

            “It was a very special moment, and one we took very seriously as scientists,” said Dr. Kovac, who chose his
            words as carefully as he tended his radio telescopes.

            Andrei Linde of Stanford, a prolific theorist who first described the most popular variant of inflation,
            known as chaotic inflation, in 1983, was about to go on vacation in the Caribbean last week when Chao-Lin
            Kuo, a Stanford colleague and a member of Dr. Kovac’s team, knocked on his door with a bottle of Champagne
            to tell him the news.

        Max Tegmark, a cosmologist at M.I.T., wrote in an email, “I think that if this stays true, it will go down as
        one of the greatest discoveries in the history of science.”

        John E. Carlstrom of the University of Chicago, Dr. Kovac’s mentor and head of a competing project called the
        South Pole Telescope, pronounced himself deeply impressed. “I think the results are beautiful and very
        convincing,” he said.

        Paul J. Steinhardt of Princeton, author of a competitor to inflation that posits the clash of a pair of
        universes as the cause of genesis, said that if true, the Bicep result would eliminate his model, but he
        expressed reservations about inflation.

        Lawrence M. Krauss of Arizona State and others also emphasized the need for confirmation, noting that the new
        results exceeded earlier estimates based on temperature maps of the cosmic background by the European Space
        Agency’s Planck satellite and other assumptions about the universe.

        “So we will need to wait and see before we jump up and down,” Dr. Krauss said.

        Corroboration might not be long in coming. The Planck spacecraft will report its own findings this year. At
        least a dozen other teams are trying similar measurements from balloons, mountaintops and space.

        Spirals in the Sky

        Gravity waves are the latest and deepest secret yet pried out of the cosmic microwaves, which were discovered
        accidentally by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson at Bell Labs 50 years ago. They won the Nobel Prize.

        Dr. Kovac has spent his career trying to read the secrets of these waves. He is one of four leaders of Bicep,
        which has operated a series of increasingly sensitive radio telescopes at the South Pole, where the thin, dry
        air creates ideal observing conditions. The others are Clement Pryke of the University of Minnesota, Jamie Bock
        of the California Institute of Technology and Dr. Kuo of Stanford.
      </p>


      <p class="stories-text quote">
        “The South Pole is the closest you can get to space and still be on the ground,” Dr. Kovac said. He has been
        there 23 times, he said, wintering over in 1994. “I’ve been hooked ever since,” he said.

      In 2002, he was part of a team that discovered that the microwave radiation was polarized, meaning the light waves
      had a slight preference to vibrate in one direction rather than another.

      This was a step toward the ultimate goal of detecting the gravitational waves from inflation. Such waves,
      squeezing space in one direction and stretching it in another as they go by, would twist the direction of
      polarization of the microwaves, theorists said. As a result, maps of the polarization in the sky should have
      little arrows going in spirals.

      Detecting those spirals required measuring infinitesimally small differences in the temperature of the microwaves.
      The group’s telescope, Bicep2, is basically a giant superconducting thermometer.

      “We had no expectations what we would see,” Dr. Kovac said.

      The strength of the signal surprised the researchers, and they spent a year burning up time on a Harvard
      supercomputer, making sure they had things right and worrying that competitors might beat them to the
      breakthrough.

      A Special Time

      The data traced the onset of inflation to a time that physicists like Dr. Guth, staying up late in his Palo Alto
      house 35 years ago, suspected was a special break point in the evolution of the universe.
